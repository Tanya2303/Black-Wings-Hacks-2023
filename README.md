## 🗃️ Best Use of MongoDB Atlas

We relied heavily on MongoDB Atlas for our project, which is one of the reasons we were able to construct such a technically challenging project so quickly. Our database was MongoDB, and we interacted with it via the graphical user interface client Mongo Atlas. As a second layer of caching, we used MongoDB. In this approach, we employ storage and computation more efficiently to give users of our software a super-fast experience. We linked our user login information and user history in DB collections. It was enjoyable to use because of MongoDB's incredibly simple interface.
